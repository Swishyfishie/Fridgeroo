## Welcome to Fridgeroo, a Sinatra MVC app that keeps track of your items in the fridge.

In order to use this app, clone it and run _"bundle install"_ to install the dependencies.   
Run _shotgun_ in your terminal and go to the localhost on the specific port shown in the terminal.

Create your user by using signup (or log in if you already have an account)

* You will be prompted to create a fridge that has a name and items.

* The items should be separated by a coma (,)

* You will be prompted to add an expiration date

* Use Delete Account to delete your account (and fridge)

* You can see other users' fridges by clicking "Users"

* You can edit your account info and the fridge items by clicking "Edit info"

Enjoy.
